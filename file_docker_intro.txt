why we used docker ? 

in simple language , we need to run or test our code in different machine or there is some case where you are working with a developer
who is using different operating system than you , its really difficult to test your code there to transfer and run in all env
we are using docker, which will generate the docker file or container file to transfer your code into the other machines#
or other development env.

there are such concept like container  , crearte a image of your container that i have to learn as soon as possible 


1. choose base machine in docker independent from the local machine
2. copy code from local machine to docker machine
3. install dependencies
4. run your script
